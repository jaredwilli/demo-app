##The Challenge


Construct a small AngularJS app to display the data (data.json) into a report resembling the provided wireframe.

##Criteria

1. Displays all information accurately, and formatted appropriately for each data type.
2. Pagination for the given data
3. **Bonus:** Sorts for the data based on most: likes, repins, and comments.
4. **Bonus:** Write your own CSS

##What We Provide

####A Web Server
A Node.js web server is provided to help you along the way. Once you clone the repo (assuming you have node installed on your path), just run this command from the project directory:

    node server.js

You will now have a server running at localhost:8888, feel free to edit server.js if you prefer a port other than 8888.

Don't have node installed? Visit [Nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)

####CSS Framework
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) is provided as a CSS framework (the JS has not been included). You *shouldn't have to* write any CSS for this project, however you are welcome to skip Foundation and write your own or import your own CSS framework if you prefer another.
